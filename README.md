# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Running the experiment
* [Download the files](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 
* All the files from the dataset should be placed inside a directory named "data" in the same directory as the run_analysis.R.
* After placing the files, the tidy data set can be generated by running the run_analysis.R script. The script will generate a txt file containing the processed data set in the same folder as the script.
* The file CodeBook.md explains the tidy data set variables.
